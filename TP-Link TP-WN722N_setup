When I first installed the TP-Link TP-WN722N I am not able to go to monitor mode.. I searched and found this script to fix the monitor mode of this device.
Thank you for the people who are behind this script and for sharing

```
git clone https://github.com/gglluukk/rtl8188eus
echo 'blacklist r8188eu'|sudo tee -a '/etc/modprobe.d/realtek.conf'
Reboot
cd rtl8188eus
make && sudo make install
Reboot 
sudo airmon-ng check kill
sudo ip link set <interface> down
sudo iw dev <interface> set type monitor

Frame injection test may be performed with (after kernel v5.2 scanning is slow, run a scan or simply an airodump-ng first!)

aireplay -9 <interface>
Add these lines below to "/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf" and ADD YOUR ADAPTER MAC below [keyfile] This will make the Network-Manager ignore the device, and therefore don't cause problems.

[device]
wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=no

[ifupdown]
managed=false

[connection]
wifi.powersave=0

[main]
plugins=keyfile

[keyfile]
unmanaged-devices=mac:A7:A7:A7:A7:A7
